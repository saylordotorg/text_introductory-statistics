Our main interest is in inferential statistics, as shown in <a class="xref" href="fwk-shafer-ch01_s01#fwk-shafer-ch01_s01_f01">Figure 1.1 "The Grand Picture of Statistics"</a> in <a class="xref" href="fwk-shafer-ch01#fwk-shafer-ch01">Chapter 1 "Introduction"</a>. Nevertheless, the starting point for dealing with a collection of data is to organize, display, and summarize it effectively. These are the objectives of descriptive statistics, the topic of this chapter.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-shafer-ch02_s01_s01_p02">How did the class do on the test? A quick glance at the set of 30 numbers does not immediately give a clear answer. However the data set may be reorganized and rewritten to make relevant information more visible. One way to do so is to construct a <strong class="emphasis bold">stem and leaf</strong> diagram as shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-shafer-ch02_s01_s01_f01">Figure 2.1 "Stem and Leaf Diagram"</a>. The numbers in the tens place, from 2 through 9, and additionally the number 10, are the “stems,” and are arranged in numerical order from top to bottom to the left of a vertical line. The number in the units place in each measurement is a “leaf,” and is placed in a row to the right of the corresponding stem, the number in the tens place of that measurement. Thus the three leaves 9, 8, and 9 in the row headed with the stem 6 correspond to the three exam scores in the 60s, 69 (in the first row of data), 68 (in the third row), and 69 (also in the third row). The display is made even more useful for some purposes by rearranging the leaves in numerical order, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-shafer-ch02_s01_s01_f02">Figure 2.2 "Ordered Stem and Leaf Diagram"</a>. Either way, with the data reorganized certain information of interest becomes apparent immediately. There are two perfect scores; three students made scores under 60; most students scored in the 70s, 80s and 90s; and the overall average is probably in the high 70s or low 80s.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-shafer-ch02_s01_s01_p03">In this example the scores have a natural stem (the tens place) and leaf (the ones place). One could spread the diagram out by splitting each tens place number into lower and upper categories. For example, all the scores in the 80s may be represented on two separate stems, lower 80s and upper 80s:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-shafer-ch02_s01_s01_p04">The definitions of stems and leaves are flexible in practice. The general purpose of a stem and leaf diagram is to provide a quick display of how the data are distributed across the range of their values; some improvisation could be necessary to obtain a diagram that best meets that goal.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-shafer-ch02_s01_s01_p05">Note that all of the original data can be recovered from the stem and leaf diagram. This will not be true in the next two types of graphical displays.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Frequency Histograms</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-shafer-ch02_s01_s02_p01">The stem and leaf diagram is not practical for large data sets, so we need a different, purely graphical way to represent data. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">frequency histogram</a><span class="glossdef">A graphical device showing how data are distributed across the range of their values by collecting them into classes and indicating the number of measurements in each class.</span></span> is such a device. We will illustrate it using the same data set from the previous subsection. For the 30 scores on the exam, it is natural to group the scores on the standard ten-point scale, and count the number of scores in each group. Thus there are two 100s, seven scores in the 90s, six in the 80s, and so on. We then construct the diagram shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-shafer-ch02_s01_s02_f01">Figure 2.3 "Frequency Histogram"</a> by drawing for each group, or class, a vertical bar whose length is the number of observations in that group. In our example, the bar labeled 100 is 2 units long, the bar labeled 90 is 7 units long, and so on. While the individual data values are lost, we know the number in each class. This number is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">frequency</a><span class="glossdef">Of a class of measurements, the number of measurements in the data set that are in the class.</span></span> of the class, hence the name frequency histogram.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-shafer-ch02_s01_s02_p02">The same procedure can be applied to any collection of numerical data. Observations are grouped into several classes and the frequency (the number of observations) of each class is noted. These classes are arranged and indicated in order on the horizontal axis (called the <em class="emphasis">x</em>-axis), and for each group a vertical bar, whose length is the number of observations in that group, is drawn. The resulting display is a frequency histogram for the data. The similarity in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-shafer-ch02_s01_s01_f01">Figure 2.1 "Stem and Leaf Diagram"</a> and <a class="xref" href="#fwk-shafer-ch02_s01_s02_f01">Figure 2.3 "Frequency Histogram"</a> is apparent, particularly if you imagine turning the stem and leaf diagram on its side by rotating it a quarter turn counterclockwise.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-shafer-ch02_s01_s02_p03">In general, the definition of the classes in the frequency histogram is flexible. The general purpose of a frequency histogram is very much the same as that of a stem and leaf diagram, to provide a graphical display that gives a sense of data distribution across the range of values that appear. We will not discuss the process of constructing a histogram from data since in actual practice it is done automatically with statistical software or even handheld calculators.</p>

        <p class="para block" id="fwk-shafer-ch02_s01_s03_p01">In our example of the exam scores in a statistics class, five students scored in the 80s. The number 5 is the <em class="emphasis">frequency</em> of the group labeled “80s.” Since there are 30 students in the entire statistics class, the proportion who scored in the 80s is 5/30. The number 5/30, which could also be expressed as <span class="inlineequation" id="shafer-20121106-125753-084206"><math xml:id="fwk-shafer-ch02-m0003" display="inline"><mn>0.1</mn><mrow><mover accent="true"><mn>6</mn><mo stretchy="true">-</mo></mover></mrow><mo>≈</mo><mo>.</mo><mn>1667</mn></math></span>, or as 16.67%, is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">relative frequency</a><span class="glossdef">Of a class of measurements, the proportion of all measurements in the data set that are in the class.</span></span> of the group labeled “80s.” Every group (the 70s, the 80s, and so on) has a relative frequency. We can thus construct a diagram by drawing for each group, or class, a vertical bar whose length is the relative frequency of that group. For example, the bar for the 80s will have length 5/30 unit, not 5 units. The diagram is a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">relative frequency histogram</a><span class="glossdef">A graphical device showing how data are distributed across the range of their values by collecting them into classes and indicating the proportion of measurements in each class.</span></span> for the data, and is shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-shafer-ch02_s01_s03_f01">Figure 2.4 "Relative Frequency Histogram"</a>. It is exactly the same as the frequency histogram except that the vertical axis in the relative frequency histogram is not frequency but relative frequency.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-shafer-ch02_s01_s03_p02">The same procedure can be applied to any collection of numerical data. Classes are selected, the relative frequency of each class is noted, the classes are arranged and indicated in order on the horizontal axis, and for each class a vertical bar, whose length is the relative frequency of the class, is drawn. The resulting display is a relative frequency histogram for the data. A key point is that now if each vertical bar has width 1 unit, then the total area of all the bars is 1 or 100%.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-shafer-ch02_s01_s03_p03">Although the histograms in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-shafer-ch02_s01_s02_f01">Figure 2.3 "Frequency Histogram"</a> and <a class="xref" href="#fwk-shafer-ch02_s01_s03_f01">Figure 2.4 "Relative Frequency Histogram"</a> have the same appearance, the relative frequency histogram is more important for us, and it will be relative frequency histograms that will be used repeatedly to represent data in this text. To see why this is so, reflect on what it is that you are actually seeing in the diagrams that quickly and effectively communicates information to you about the data. It is the <em class="emphasis">relative sizes</em> of the bars. The bar labeled “70s” in either figure takes up 1/3 of the total area of all the bars, and although we may not think of this consciously, we perceive the proportion 1/3 in the figures, indicating that a third of the grades were in the 70s. The relative frequency histogram is important because the labeling on the vertical axis reflects what is important visually: the relative sizes of the bars.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-shafer-ch02_s01_s03_p04">When the size <em class="emphasis">n</em> of a sample is small only a few classes can be used in constructing a relative frequency histogram. Such a histogram might look something like the one in panel (a) of <a class="xref" href="#fwk-shafer-ch02_s01_s03_f02">Figure 2.5 "Sample Size and Relative Frequency Histograms"</a>. If the sample size <em class="emphasis">n</em> were increased, then more classes could be used in constructing a relative frequency histogram and the vertical bars of the resulting histogram would be finer, as indicated in panel (b) of <a class="xref" href="#fwk-shafer-ch02_s01_s03_f02">Figure 2.5 "Sample Size and Relative Frequency Histograms"</a>. For a very large sample the relative frequency histogram would look very fine, like the one in (c) of <a class="xref" href="#fwk-shafer-ch02_s01_s03_f02">Figure 2.5 "Sample Size and Relative Frequency Histograms"</a>. If the sample size were to increase indefinitely then the corresponding relative frequency histogram would be so fine that it would look like a smooth curve, such as the one in panel (d) of <a class="xref" href="#fwk-shafer-ch02_s01_s03_f02">Figure 2.5 "Sample Size and Relative Frequency Histograms"</a>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-shafer-ch02_s01_s03_p05">It is common in statistics to represent a population or a very large data set by a smooth curve. It is good to keep in mind that such a curve is actually just a very fine relative frequency histogram in which the exceedingly narrow vertical bars have disappeared. Because the area of each such vertical bar is the proportion of the data that lies in the interval of numbers over which that bar stands, this means that for any two numbers <em class="emphasis">a</em> and <em class="emphasis">b</em>, the proportion of the data that lies between the two numbers <em class="emphasis">a</em> and <em class="emphasis">b</em> is the area under the curve that is above the interval (<em class="emphasis">a</em>,<em class="emphasis">b</em>) in the horizontal axis. This is the area shown in <a class="xref" href="#fwk-shafer-ch02_s01_s03_f03">Figure 2.6 "A Very Fine Relative Frequency Histogram"</a>.

We will see that the nature of the data set, as indicated by a relative frequency histogram, will determine what constitutes a good answer. Different shapes of the histogram call for different measures of central location.</p>

In the formula in the following definition we introduce the standard summation notation Σ, where Σ is the capital Greek letter sigma. In general, the notation Σ followed by a second mathematical symbol means to add up all the values that the second symbol can take in the context of the problem. Here is an example to illustrate this.</p>

It is approximately twice what six of the seven employees in the sample make and is nowhere near what any of them makes. It is easy to see what went wrong: the presence of the one executive in the sample, whose salary is so large compared to everyone else’s, caused the numerator in the formula for the sample mean to be far too large, pulling the mean far to the right of where we think that the average “ought” to be, namely around $24,000 or $25,000. The number 192.5 in our data set is called an <strong class="emphasis bold">outlier</strong>, a number that is far removed from most or all of the remaining measurements. Many times an outlier is the result of some sort of error, but not always, as is the case here.

Nevertheless a glance at the figure shows that they are markedly different. In Data Set I the measurements vary only slightly from the center, while for Data Set II the measurements vary greatly. Just as we have attached numbers to a data set to locate its center, we now wish to associate to each data set numbers that measure quantitatively how the data either scatter away from the center or cluster close to it. These new quantities are called measures of variability, and we will discuss three of them.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="fwk-shafer-ch02_s04_p01">When you take an exam, what is often as important as your actual score on the exam is the way your score compares to other students’ performance. If you made a 70 but the average score (whether the mean, median, or mode) was 85, you did relatively poorly. If you made a 70 but the average score was only 55 then you did relatively well. In general, the significance of one observed value in a data set strongly depends on how that value compares to the other observed values in a data set. Therefore we wish to attach to each observed value a number that measures its relative position.</p>

The Empirical Rule does not apply to data sets with severely asymmetric distributions, and the actual percentage of observations in any of the intervals specified by the rule could be either greater or less than those given in the rule.

            <p class="para" id="fwk-shafer-ch02_s05_s01_p09">Since 68% of the IQ scores lie <em class="emphasis">within</em> the interval from 90 to 110, it must be the case that 32% lie <em class="emphasis">outside</em> that interval. By symmetry approximately half of that 32%, or 16% of all IQ scores, will lie above 110. If 16% lie above 110, then 84% lie below. We conclude that the IQ score 110 is the 84th percentile.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-shafer-ch02_s05_s01_p10">The same analysis applies to the score 120. Since approximately 95% of all IQ scores lie within the interval form 80 to 120, only 5% lie outside it, and half of them, or 2.5% of all scores, are above 120. The IQ score 120 is thus higher than 97.5% of all IQ scores, and is quite a high score.</p>
            <p class="para" id="fwk-shafer-ch02_s05_s01_p11">By a similar argument, only 15/100 of 1% of all adults, or about one or two in every thousand, would have an IQ score above 130. This fact makes the score 130 extremely high.</p>

                <li>Statement (4) is definitely correct and statement (4) implies statement (6): even if every measurement that is outside the interval (675,775) is less than 675 (which is conceivable, since symmetry is not known to hold), even so at most 25% of all observations are less than 675.
